acupwith.me -- Release version

This is the source code for the current release of acupwith.me. 
acupwith.me is an web app designed to allow bored Berkeley coffee drinkers to connect with each other for conversations etc.
It is currently developed and maintained by Brian Sang and Andy Li, two UC Berkeley students and originally built during the CSUA hackathon (see v0 for that release).



Note that the acupwithme/settings.py file was removed for security reasons.
